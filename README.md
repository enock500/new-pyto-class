# Myself 
My father is a pastorr and my mother is a pastor. Loving their profession is one of the greatest inspirations they provide me each day. I am the only child of my parents. They keep me motivated and always make me learn from my failures. Your family is one of the backbone and support which helps you stand in todayâ€™s cutthroat competition.

## My mother:
she has always been an inspiration to me. She is my absolute role model and I truly aspire to become like her. Therefore, I always try to follow her rules and principles.

My school has an important role in my holistic development. Whatever I am today, is just because of my family and friends and my school. My teachers have always taught me to be energetic and full of positivity. They inspire me each day to be better.

I am a bookworm and I enjoy reading various types of novels as well as classic literature like Shakespearean dramas. I also love to go through Indian history as I have a deep interest in knowing about it. Apart from reading, I am very fond of writing poems of my choice. Recently, I am also focussing on Learning

To be honest, I am also fond of social media and love to play online games. One of the favorite games which I love to play nowadays is the 3-D racing car.

I would also like to mention my best friend Neema who always stays with me and gives me motivation and courage. Even if it is a small help from taking class notes to eating together, Edddy has always been important to me. Friends are a very significant part of your life and true friends are always there with you in every up and down of life. check this out <http://www.google.com>
# THREE PYTHON KEYWORDS 
The "return" statement
**********************

   return_stmt ::= "return" [expression_list]

"return" may only occur syntactically nested in a function definition,
not within a nested class definition.

If an expression list is present, it is evaluated, else "None" is
substituted.

"return" leaves the current function call with the expression list (or
# The "nonlocal" statement
************************

   nonlocal_stmt ::= "nonlocal" identifier ("," identifier)*

The "nonlocal" statement causes the listed identifiers to refer to
previously bound variables in the nearest enclosing scope excluding
globals. This is important because the default behavior for binding is
to search the local namespace first.  The statement allows
encapsulated code to rebind variables outside of the local scope
besides the global (module) scope.

# Membership test operations
**************************

The operators "in" and "not in" test for membership.  "x in s"
evaluates to "True" if *x* is a member of *s*, and "False" otherwise.
"x not in s" returns the negation of "x in s".  All built-in sequences
and set types support this as well as dictionary, for which "in" tests
whether the dictionary has a given key. For container types such as
list, tuple, set, frozenset, dict, or collections.deque, the
expression "x in y" is equivalent to "any(x is e or x == e for e in
y)".......,...............


Well done......
