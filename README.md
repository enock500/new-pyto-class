# THREE PYTHON KEYWORDS 
The "return" statement
**********************

   return_stmt ::= "return" [expression_list]

"return" may only occur syntactically nested in a function definition,
not within a nested class definition.

If an expression list is present, it is evaluated, else "None" is
substituted.

"return" leaves the current function call with the expression list (or
# The "nonlocal" statement
************************

   nonlocal_stmt ::= "nonlocal" identifier ("," identifier)*

The "nonlocal" statement causes the listed identifiers to refer to
previously bound variables in the nearest enclosing scope excluding
globals. This is important because the default behavior for binding is
to search the local namespace first.  The statement allows
encapsulated code to rebind variables outside of the local scope
besides the global (module) scope.

# Membership test operations
**************************

The operators "in" and "not in" test for membership.  "x in s"
evaluates to "True" if *x* is a member of *s*, and "False" otherwise.
"x not in s" returns the negation of "x in s".  All built-in sequences
and set types support this as well as dictionary, for which "in" tests
whether the dictionary has a given key. For container types such as
list, tuple, set, frozenset, dict, or collections.deque, the
expression "x in y" is equivalent to "any(x is e or x == e for e in
y)".......,...............


Well done......
